**VA** is an app for visually impaired people that announces objects detected using user's phone camera.

Our goal is to help visually impaired people to become more independent.

## WIP / For future

- [ ] Improve OCR reader.
- [ ] Change to React Native.
- [ ] Transfer to cloud processing rather than on-device.
- [ ] Currency classification. Name what banknote that is seen in the camera.
- [ ] Facial recognition. Each user will have their own pool of people saved in the app for future facial recognition tasks.
- [ ] Image description. Describe what's in the image.
- [ ] _'Open with VA'_ on images to do OCR/ facial recognition/ image description.
